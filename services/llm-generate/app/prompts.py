"""System prompt templates for LLM calls.

Each prompt describes the role of the language model in the
question‑answering pipeline. Keeping prompts in a dedicated module makes
them easier to update and avoids accidental duplication across
services. These strings are intended to be passed to an LLM as the
system message when constructing chat completions.
